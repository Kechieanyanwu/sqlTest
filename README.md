Testing connecting a server to a PostgreSQL database

Learning how to connect a PostgreSQL database to a server as part of my backend course. This will help with data persistence, which would have been additional functionality in my Envelope Budgeting Application (it only had in-session memory).

I look forward to building projects which are able to store, manipulate and retrive external data.  

P.S. If you'd like to check this out, please run "npm i" to download the required modules. As this is a test project, I am not including more detailed documentation and instructions to run.
